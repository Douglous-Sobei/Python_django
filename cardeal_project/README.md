# cardeal-project
> Hello,I have developed a web application for car sales using django framework. My basic scenario of this project was making a website for a car business owner who wants to list his car and his website and allow the user to come to the website and browse through all his latest cars and featured cars, search and filter the cars by model or price and make some inquiries about his cars that are out for sale.
> I started by creating a virtual environment, created general apps and setup my relational database.
> I Have setup django static files and media files. Also, I have customized my panel so that it matches with the website first and an awesomesome search functionality.
> You will be amazed to see unlimitted list of cars with dynamic page numbers, then general messages to show the user a success or error notification will be making login and registration forms which authenticate the user.
> In addition, I have also integrated login with gooogle and login with facebook functionality
